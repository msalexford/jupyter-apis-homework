**About the Assignment**\
This assignment involved using the Weather API to practice accessing information nested within lists and dictionaries.

**Something I Learned**\
I learned how to iterate within dictionaries using for loops.

**Something I Found Challenging**\
I struggled with questions 5 and 6 of part 1 - in which we were asked to go through the daily forecasts, printing out the next week's worth of predictions.
When I finally figured out how to pull and print the hourly data from the Miami endpoint, I thought I could use similar code to go back and figure out 5 & 6 but had no luck. I kept hitting the error 'list indices must be integers or slices, not str'.
